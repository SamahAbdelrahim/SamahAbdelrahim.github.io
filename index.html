        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Samah (or in Arabic سماح), A PhD student in the psychology department at Stanford University. </p>
        <p>I identify as a developmental psychologist under construction :D </p>
        <p> I love thinking about how children do all that they do; but specifically how they acquire language </p>
        <p> When i am not in building 420, neither thinking about children, i like listening to Arabic music, watching TV, chatting with Family and friend, and reading about Islamic Sufism </p>
